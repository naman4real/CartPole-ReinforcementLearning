# CartPole-ReinforcementLearning
-This project inolved applied Reinfocrcement learnging viz,. Deep Q Learning for the 'cart' to learn to balance the pole.
-Uses Open AI Gym CartPole-v0 environment.
-Built the deep convolutional neural netork with PyTorch.
-The CNN is used as a approximator to predict the optimal action given a set of images as inputs states. (the state that the game is in)
-Code is directed to run on GPU.
-Feel free to clone/download or even contribute.
CHEERS!
